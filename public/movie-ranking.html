<hr />

<h3>Volver</h3>
<p>
A 2006 Spanish dark comedy written and directed by Pedro Almod√≥var.<br />
A beautiful, heart-warming film starring the perfect Penelope Cruz.<br />
This film left me feeling warm and fuzzy for days.<br />
</p>

<h3>ET The Extraterrestrial</h3>
<p>
A 1982 American science fiction film produced and directed by Steven Spielberg<br />
A young boy and his friends helps a cute alien get home.<br />
I saw this for the first time in my twenties. I think i got something in my eye at the end of the film...<br />
<p>

<h3>Home Alone</h3>
<p>
A 1990 American Christmas comedy film directed by Chris Columbus.<br />
An eight year old boy gets left behind on a family vacation and ends up defending his house against a pair of gullible burglars.<br />
I loved this film even more because it made my kids laugh so much they nearly peed themselves.<br />
